# Android Adaptive Navigation: Bottom Nav Bars, Nav Drawers, and Nav Rails with Jetpack Compose

Use bottom nav bars for compact layouts, nav drawers for double panel layouts, and use nav rails for
larger, landscape layouts. And don't forget to support table top and book postures for foldables!
This branch includes navigation layout templates to render adaptive content in Jetpack Compose apps.
It uses WindowSizeClass and WindowInfoTracker to get window sizes and folding features. This app
supports phones, tablets, split screens, and foldable devices.
