# Create, Read, and Patch with Ktor Client and Jetpack Compose

Watch a demo of my Jetpack Compose app from start to finish, featuring phone and tablet
adaptive layouts, Google One Tap Sign in, and Material 3 glass morphism design elements. Then I'll
go over the final screens, which allow users to create, get, and patch apps. When an app is created,
the API auto-generates an API key that developers can use to query city data.
